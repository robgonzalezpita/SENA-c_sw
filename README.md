# Overview

This repository contains a stand-alone kernel for the `c_sw` subroutine,
extracted from the FV3 model. The goal of this repository is to facilitate
direct comparisons of different implementations of `c_sw`. Alternative
implementations may use different programming languages, parallel programming
models, or numerical modeling libraries. They may also target different
hardware such as GPUs or ARM processors. In numerical modeling, metrics
for comparison traditionally include performance and portability. However,
this work encourages comparison of developer productivity and design metrics
such as ease of use, extensibility, and maintainability.

A Fortran 90 implementation of `c_sw` is provided as a baseline reference
to which other implementations should be compared. Additional implementations
will be added as they are developed.

# Contents

This repository is organized as follows.

### `data/`

Contains the reference input and output data all implementations must use
for testing and validation.

### `ref/`

Contains the source tree for the reference implementation. See the README
in that directory for details about how to run and test it.

### `foo/`

Alternative implementations will be stored in a new top-level subdirectory
along side the reference implementation. In this documentation, `foo/` is
simply a place holder for names given to future implementations.

# Contributing

Contributors who wish to provide an alternative implementation of `c_sw`
must do so by issuing a Pull Request to the `develop` branch from their
own forks of this repository. Write access to this repository can not be
granted.

All pull requests to this repository must include:

* A build system that functions across platforms and (if applicable) across
multiple compilers.
* Source code that is well written, properly formatted, and documented.
* A test suite that passes and duplicates the tests that are run in the
reference implementation. At present, 11 digits of accuracy are expected.
* A GitHub Actions configuration to automate the new implementation's
test suite.
* A documentation README.md describing the new implementation, including how
to run and test it.
